			/*
			  This array defines translations from font-family in CSS or HTML
			  to the internal font-family name used in mPDF.
			  Can include as many as want, regardless of which fonts are installed.
			  By default mPDF will take a CSS/HTML font-family and remove spaces
			  and change to lowercase e.g. "Times New Roman" will be recognised as
			  "timesnewroman"
			  You only need to define additional translations.
			  You can also use it to define specific substitutions e.g.
			  'helvetica' => 'arial'
			  Generic substitutions (i.e. to a sans-serif or serif font) are set
			  by including the font-family in e.g. 'sans_fonts' below

			  This array lists the file names of the TrueType .ttf or .otf font files
			  for each variant of the (internal mPDF) font-family name.
			  ['R'] = Regular (Normal), others are Bold, Italic, and Bold-Italic
			  Each entry must contain an ['R'] entry, but others are optional.
			  Only the font (files) entered here will be available to use in mPDF.
			  Put preferred default first in order
			  This will be used if a named font cannot be found in any of
			  'sans_fonts', 'serif_fonts' or 'mono_fonts'

			  ['sip-ext'] = 'sun-extb', name a related font file containing SIP characters

			  ['useKashida'] => 75,	Enable use of kashida for text justification in Arabic text

			  If a .ttc TrueType collection file is referenced, the number of the font

					'R' => "cambria.ttc",
					'B' => "cambriab.ttf",
					'I' => "cambriai.ttf",
					'BI' => "cambriaz.ttf",

			// These next 3 arrays do two things:
			// 1. If a font referred to in HTML/CSS is not available to mPDF, these arrays will determine whether
			//    a serif/sans-serif or monospace font is substituted
			// 2. The first font in each array will be the font which is substituted in circumstances as above
			//     (Otherwise the order is irrelevant)
			// Use the mPDF font-family names i.e. lowercase and no spaces (after any translations in $fonttrans)
