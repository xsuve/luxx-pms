# luxx PMS - Project Management System
luxx PMS was a project management system I've developed for commercial purposes. It was available for sale for a few years on CodeCanyon. You could also extend the features with custom made modules such as Calendar, Expenses Tracker, Time Tracker, etc. Eventually the development closed and I moved to more important stuff.

### Years Active
